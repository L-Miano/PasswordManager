🔐 Password Manager
Welcome to the Password Manager – a simple, lightweight, and secure web-based tool that allows users to save, manage, and generate passwords locally within their browser. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project focuses on user convenience, security awareness, and minimal design, all while functioning completely offline.

🎯 Features
- Save and manage website login details (Website, Username, Password)

- Generate strong, random passwords with one click

- Show/hide stored passwords

- Delete individual saved entries

- Data stored locally using localStorage (no server required)

- Clean and responsive dark-themed UI

🌐 How It Works
This password manager stores all credentials in the browser’s localStorage, allowing users to access and manage their data without sending it over the internet. It’s ideal for personal use, testing, or learning how client-side apps handle data.

⚠️ Security Note
While convenient, storing passwords in plain text—even locally—comes with risks (e.g., from browser-based attacks like XSS). This version does not use encryption. Users should be cautious and use it for non-sensitive accounts or local development purposes only.

📁 Technologies Used
- HTML – Structure and form layout

- CSS – Dark mode styling and responsive design

- JavaScript – Logic for password management and generation

🚀 Getting Started
To use the app:

- Clone or download the repository

- Open the index.html file in your browser
